     # User Interface

     At its heart, Visual Studio Code is a code editor. Like many other code editors, VS Code adopts a common user interface and layout of an explorer on the left, showing all of the files and folders you have access to, and an editor on the right, showing the content of the files you have opened.

# Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.

Basic Layout
VS Code comes with a simple and intuitive layout that maximizes the space provided for the editor, while leaving ample room to browse and access the full context of your folder or project.

- Activity Bar - Located on the far left-hand side. Lets you switch between views and gives you additional context-specific indicators, like the number of outgoing changes when Git is enabled. You can change the position of the Activity Bar.
- Side Bar - Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your project.
  there are two types of side bar...
  - Primary Side Bar - Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your project.
  - A Secondary Side Bar is also available to display views opposite the Primary Side Bar. You can show it with Ctrl+Alt+B and drag a view from the Primary Side Bar to the Secondary Side Bar. ![SIDE BAR](33.png)
- Editor Group - The main area to edit your files. You can open as many editors as you like side by side vertically and horizontally.
  Status Bar - Information about the opened project and the files you edit.

4. Command Palette:

   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.

   The Command Palette in Visual Studio Code enables users to swiftly find and apply commands. Accessing the Command Palette can be achieved through View > Command Palette or by using keyboard shortcuts Cmd–Shift–P (Mac) or Ctrl–Shift–P (Windows). The Command Palette can be utilized to transform selected text into title case.
